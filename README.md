# React Native Unhandled Promise Rejection: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')

This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: `Unhandled Promise Rejection: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')`. This error arises when you attempt to use the `.map()` method on an array that is currently undefined or null. This often happens when dealing with asynchronous data fetching where the data might not be available immediately.

## Bug Description
The bug is caused by attempting to render a component that uses the `.map()` method on an array before that array has been properly populated with data. This typically occurs when fetching data from an API or other asynchronous source.  The component renders before the data has fully loaded, causing the `undefined` error.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the data is available before attempting to render the component that uses it.  This is usually accomplished by using conditional rendering or state management to only render the component once the data has been fetched.
